# IT120-FINAL-PROJECT

The Flower Classification mobile app has a well-organized and intuitive flow aimed at assisting users to correctly recognise orchid species based on artificial intelligence. After opening the application, the users are guided to the Home screen where the objective of the application is clearly defined as well as the features it provides. Through this screen, one has options to use the devices camera to take a picture or post an existing image in the gallery. The system then feeds the image chosen and sends it to a trained TensorFlow Lite model which interprets the visual characteristics of the flower in order to identify its respective type of orchid.

Once the classification has been done, the system compares the prediction to a predefined confidence threshold that has been established by the user in the Settings screen. When the confidence level is at or above the threshold, the result is passed and shown to the user and its confidence percentage. Per the user preferences, the result and classified image can be saved automatically, and a notification can be provided to the user to inform him or her of the successful detection. The results of all the classifications are saved and can be revisited later on the History screen where a user can track past detections.

Besides personal outcomes, the application gives an Analytics screen, which represents detection data in charts and summary statistics. This functionality enables users to track detection rates per flower type, trend in confidence and general classification system performance. To fine-tune the application behavior, the user can use the Settings screen where the user is able to change the confidence threshold, image quality, appearance of the theme, data storage settings, and cloud backup settings. By such an integrated flow, the application guarantees effective classification of flowers, data management and user-friendly experience.
